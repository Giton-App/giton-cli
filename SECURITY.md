## Report a security issue

Giton welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [giton@omarabid.com](mailto:giton@omarabid.com). Security issues should not be reported via the public Github Issue tracker.

## Vulnerability coordination

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via [Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of Giton, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. We announce security issues via [project Github Release notes](https://github.com/Giton-App/giton-cli/releases).
